# Soc_cp_submission
Hey! My PC's currently broken, else I'd have uploaded my folder of code here (I'm currently borrowing my father's laptop while it gets fixed). The project was quite fun, and I learned a lot. I now have a good deal of familiarity with CP. Not only did tarush teach us much about data structures and common algorithms himself, showing us things like greedy algorithms and examples, trees, graphs, linked lists and such very well, but he helped greatly with the logistics side of things too. I am now comfortable with codeforces, have access to antti laaksonen's book and the good bits of hackerrank, have moved away from arrays and pointers to vectors and iterators, and even finally getting away from simplecpp to a proper system with vscode on wsl. I'm also comfortable with looking up stuff I don't know on google and reading up cplusplus articles.
